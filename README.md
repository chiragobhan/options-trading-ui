# üßÆ Options Trading UI (Frontend Only)

A **frontend-only prototype** of an options trading interface, inspired by apps like **Betmount** and **Probo**. This React-based UI lets users explore categories, simulate trades, and view their wallet ‚Äî but does **not** connect to any backend or submit real trades.
